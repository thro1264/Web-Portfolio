		<p>My name is Teddy Robinson! I grew up in Bristol, Rhode Island and I'm currently a student in the Technology Arts & Media program at The University of Colorado at Boulder. I'm passionate about making both physically and digitally. On my computer, I love 3D Modeling, web design, graphic design, and typography. With my hands, I love bringing my CAD creations to life in whatever material that may be and working on cars. In my freetime I love skiing, surfing, sailing, hiking, and rock climbing.</p>

					<h3>Volvo 240</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In the summer of 2018, my friend Levi and I drove to South Windsor, CT and bought a 1990 Volvo 240 sedan for $450. We spent the next two summers replacing the water pump, thermostat, timing belt, radiator hoses, ignition coils, spark plugs, flame trapbrake rotors, brake pads, main fuel pump, inline fuel pump, fuel filter, fuel sender, ball joints and transmission cross member. However, after reassembling my engine, during my celebratory first drive, I heard a rattling noise caused by the cam shaft bolt slowly wigling itself undone causing the cam shaft to become misaligned and the connecting rod of piston 1 to go straight through the side of the block, leaving a 2 inch hole in the side of my engine. So, during the last month of the summer, we took apart the old engine, swapped over all usable parts to a junkyard B230F engine, resealed it, and swapped it into my car.<br><br>Today the 240 is my daily driver. Here's a picture of it in the Surfer's End parking lot at Sachuest Beach in Newport, RI.</p>

					<h3>Typographic Booklet</h3>
				</header>
				<p>For this project, I was tasked with making an accordion booklet, with a typographic design, that expressed the emotion and meaning of a lyric of my choice. For this booklet, I chose to use the lyrics from the song 'Cause I'm A Man' by Tame Impala.</p>

					<h3>Wooden Slices Chair</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This chair was designed using a combination of digital and physical production techniques. First, I created a 3D model of the basic shape of my chair in Rhinoceros, which I then imported into Fusion360's slicer program to transform the model into  a series of interconnected slices. I then exported the outlines of each slice into a laser cutter, and using sheets of Â¼ inch plywood I created a basic chair design consisting of interlocked wooden slices.</p>
